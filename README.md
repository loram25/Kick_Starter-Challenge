# Kick_Starter-Challenge
Data Analysis
The conclusions I can draw from the provided data from Kickstarter campaigns are the following:
Overall, Kickstarter campaigns are more likely to succeed with a 53.8% success rate than fail with a 37.6% rate or get cancelled with an 8.6% rate.
Limitations
The limitations I found with this dataset are the following:
In order to provide a more thorough analysis for generating actionable insights we need a larger dataset since this dataset only includes 9 parent categories and 41 sub-categories.
There is no data on if a successful campaign came to fruition or was the project actually completed; was the project successful in the real world and was a business started?
Also, no specific locations are provided other than country. It would be great to have the city in which the campaigns originated to visualize success by part of the country (i.e. in the US it would be states and cities).
Other Possible Tables and/or Graphs
The following additional tables and/or graphs can be created:
A bar chart to display with number of days campaign ran and their outcome to determine if the length of the campaign affects its success rate.
A pivot table using location and outcomes with a map chart visualizing by country the comparison of number of campaigns initiated in that country and their success rate.
